    <h3>A Retro 2D Beat 'Em Up Built with Godot 4.4</h3>
</div>

**Bars n Bruises** is a pixel-art, arcade-style 2D beat 'em up game developed in Godot 4.4. Set in neon-lit streets and a gritty prison environment, you play as a fearless fighter battling delinquents to uphold equality. Punch, kick, and combo your way through enemies in crunchy 8-bit action, inspired by classic NES and arcade brawlers. With retro synth beats and side-scrolling chaos, this prototype delivers intense brawls and a modular, scalable codebase.

## üéÆ About the Game

- **Pixel-Art Aesthetic**: Crunchy 8-bit visuals with vibrant neon environments.
- **Retro Vibes**: Synth-heavy soundtrack and classic arcade gameplay.
